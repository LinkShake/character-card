      description: `Pennywise, also known as It, is the malevolent shape-shifting entity in Stephen King's "It."

Its face is painted with a sinister, eternal grin, revealing sharp, yellowed teeth that inspire dread.

Its chilling, yellow eyes seem to pierce through one's soul, and its crimson, tattered clown suit is a stark contrast to the darkness it represents. An ID for It would capture the unnerving and otherworldly appearance of the malevolent clown, striking terror into anyone who gazes upon it.`,
